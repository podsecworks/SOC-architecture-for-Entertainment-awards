# SOC Architecture for Academy Awards Voting Process (Fictitious Use Case)

This project demonstrates a fictitious setup of a Security Operations Center (SOC) architecture for securing the Academy Awards voting process. The aim of this project is to showcase cybersecurity knowledge in designing, deploying, and managing a secure infrastructure for a high-profile, time-sensitive event. **This is purely a fictional use case and not affiliated with the actual Academy Awards.**

## Project Overview

In this project, we simulate the architecture required to monitor and protect a voting environment for the Academy Awards. The voting system is designed with a focus on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, ensuring that the voting process remains secure and resilient against potential threats. 

The SOC architecture includes key components such as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, and a SIEM system to aggregate and analyze logs. The infrastructure is defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, with Terraform, Ansible, and Docker configurations to simplify deployment and management.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is for demonstration and learning purposes only, and no real voting data or production environment is involved.

The above architecture diagram represents the core components of the SOC setup, including network segmentation, monitoring systems, secure access controls, and logging.

## Components

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Isolated environment to host the voting system components.
- **SIEM Server:** Aggregates logs and monitors for suspicious activities (e.g., ELK Stack).
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** Monitors network traffic for threats (e.g., Suricata).
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Provides real-time endpoint protection.
- **Firewall and Security Groups:** Control access and enforce network segmentation.
- **VPN Gateway:** Allows secure access for SOC administrators.

## Prerequisites

To set up and deploy this architecture, you will need the following:
- **Git** for version control
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Ansible** for configuration management
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerized applications (SIEM, IDS)
- **AWS CLI** or similar for cloud provider access (assuming AWS for this example)
